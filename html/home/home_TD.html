        <h2>What is a Template?</h2>
        <p>
            Alongside your taxonomy and category documentation, ChannelAdvisor requires additional information on your product fields in order to properly surface these to sellers in our platform.
        </p>

        <p>
            A template is the seller-facing version of the fields on your taxonomy.
            Templates within the ChannelAdvisor platform show, to the seller, the field names,
            their requirement status as well as added context (called Help Text) in order to assist the seller in mapping their template.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Submit Your Template Definition File</h3>
        <p>
            We offer a standard template to our Access ChannelAdvisor partners which includes standard fields which are similar across channels. You can download a copy of our standard
            template <a href="/Home/Introduction/DownloadTemplate?fileName=Standard_Template_Definition.xlsx">here</a>. Should our standard template not match your requirements, you must opt for a custom template.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a custom template, you can provide all fields relevant to your specific channel. Please note that a custom template requires additional development work and, as such, may incur a cost.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to help you supply us with your custom template, we have provided a document which will give you an overview of the required data points with examples and suggestions to help you complete the file.
            You can download a copy of the file <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BlgimR9J7mjXAb2_C3NS6WqOENxfr3mGIROdVKxl8FQ" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our engineering team cannot commence the ChannelAdvisor side of the development
            process without this information, so timing is critical.
            Please ensure your template definition file is either at same time as you are preparing for final verification or before.
        </p>
