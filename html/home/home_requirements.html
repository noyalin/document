        <blockquote>Requirements page outlines in detail what deliverables are required for each marketplace.</blockquote>
        <p>
            Along with the technical integration and requirements,
            there is basic information that ChannelAdvisor will need to be able to create a template for sellers to
            provide product data in your required format. We also require additional information from you that will
            enable us to communicate the value of your site to our sellers and to prepare them to connect to your
            program through ChannelAdvisor.
        </p>

        <p>
            You should start preparing the following deliverables as soon as your agreement is signed with
            ChannelAdvisor.
            It is also important to note that we cannot commence ChannelAdvisor development as outlined in the process
            flow until we receive the following information; any delays in receiving these details will push out your
            potential go-live date.
