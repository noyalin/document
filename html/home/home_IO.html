        <h1>Integration Overview</h1>
        <blockquote>The purpose of this page is to outline the integration process between your system and ChannelAdvisor.</blockquote>
        <p>
            <img src="../../img/integrationflow.png">

        <h3><a>Integration Project Steps:</a></h3>
        <h4>Agreement Signed</h4>
        <p>
            All partners wishing to participate in the Access ChannelAdvisor program must agree to the program’s terms and conditions.
            Please contact <a href="mailto:partners@channeladvisor.com">partners@channeladvisor.com</a> or your existing ChannelAdvisor business contact.
        </p>

        <h4>Delivery of Non-API Requirements</h4>
        <p>
            The creation of the endpoints is critical to the creation of the integration but so are these other materials. We can’t make your program available to our merchants without them.
            Please start work on these materials in parallel with your API endpoint development. You can find a list on the non-API requirements <a href="/Home/Introduction/Requirements">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>Partner API Development</h4>
        <p>
            Now it’s time to get to work. Use the <a href="/ApiDocumentation/TechnicalRequirements/General">Documentation</a> to create the endpoints as defined.
            We’ve had partners complete this work in a little as one day but it may take you longer depending on the specifics of your systems.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="/Partners/voyageone">Initial Validation</a></h4>
        <p>
            At the point where either products or orders coding (or both) is completed, you can conduct basic testing of your endpoints within this portal (under Partner&gt;API Validator Tool).
            The purpose of initial validation is to establish that basic "happy path" call and response information can be sent and received from ChannelAdvisor to the integration you have built.
            This is meant to be an iterative process where coding will occur, and then validation will run, and any errors are resolved in the next round of coding.
        </p>

        <h4>Preparing for Final Verification</h4>
        <p>
            Use of the API Validator Tool is just the first level of testing necessary to ensure a reliable connection and therefore a successful program.
            Once you’ve completed the initial validation using the tool, you need to prepare for the final verification step.
            You can do so by reviewing the battery of tests ChannelAdvisor will conduct as well as sample of data we’ll use to ensure your system is ready.
            The full list of tests can be seen under Partner&gt;Final Verification, you will also be able to see the sample data we’ll use on this page.
            Once you are confident you are ready to pass these tests <b>AND</b> you have submitted all the information outlined on the Requirements page (Home&gt;Requirements), please notify ChannelAdvisor’s Partner Support team at <a href="mailto:partnersupport@channeladvisor.com">partnersupport@channeladvisor.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="/Partners/voyageone/FinalVerification">Final Verification by ChannelAdvisor</a></h4>
        <p>
            This is when ChannelAdvisor run the tests outlined above. Our partner support team will notify you of the status on a regular basis,
            indicating which tests have passed and which require action on your part. Once any actions required on your part are completed,
            please notify us so we can run the battery of tests again.
        </p>

        <h4>Launch Phase 1 - Early Adopters</h4>
        <p>
            After final validation is completed and has passed testing, we will then work to make the channel available to an initial set of ChannelAdvisor sellers.
            We will use the documentation provided by you to present the value of your program to sellers and make it easier for them to configure their ChannelAdvisor account appropriately.
        </p>

        <h4>Launch Phase 2 - General Availability</h4>
        <p>
            Once we are comfortable via the Early Adopter Phase that the integration is stable,
            we will make it available to all of our customers in the geographical regions relevant to your program. If any issues arise with the connection,
            we will notify you via our partner support team.
