<h1>Initial Validation - Overview </h1>
<blockquote>Details on the initial validation procedure</blockquote>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    Initial API validation is done by way of the online API validator tool:
    a utility that runs a series of tests against your Access ChannelAdvisor
    API and provides real-time feedback to partners about any endpoints that display behavior
    or return responses that are not consistent with the API requirements as outlined in the
    <a href="/ApiDocumentation/Reference/Endpoints">Endpoints</a>
    section of this documentation. This allows your developers to verify basic API functionality,
    ensure proper payload structure, and detect bugs in your API endpoints.
</p>

<h4>What the validator tool tests</h4>
<p>
    Validation is divided into two test suites-- one suite for orders endpoints, and one for products (see below).
    Each suite contains a certain number of tests. Each suite can be run independently, allowing partners to develop
    and test the orders and products endpoints concurrently. However, each test within a suite relies
    on the data and successful outcome of the preceding test of that suite in order to run.
    For this reason, the test suite terminates once the first validation failure is detected.
</p>

<h4>What the validator tool does <em>not</em> test</h4>
<p>
    Although the validator tool does verify some basic functionality of the API endpoints,
    it is not comprehensive. For example, it does not attempt to test:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pending status orders</li>
    <li>Partial cancellations</li>
    <li>Partial refunds</li>
    <li>Partial shipments</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    Additionally, the validator tool is currently configured only for standard Access API implementations.
    If any of the following are true about your API, you may not be able to complete a successful validator run
    of one or both test suites. If this is the case, please email your technical contact.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cannot return async responses within a few minutes</li>
    <li>Does not support cancellations</li>
    <li>Does not support refunds</li>
    <li>Does not support shipments</li>
    <li>Requires products fields other than those defined on the as defined on the <a
            href="/ApiDocumentation/Products/TemplateFields">Product Fields</a> page
    </li>
    <li>Has strict data requirements on product fields</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
    We are constantly working to make the API development process as easy as possible. In the future, we hope to
    expand the validator to verify more endpoints and situations, as well as to add more configuration options to
    handle channels with special Access API implementations as outlined above.
</p>

<h4>Validation test results</h4>
<p>
    At the end of each test suite run, the result of the test suite is displayed, indicating the status of each test.
    If the test failed, there will also be a message indicating which aspect of the API failed to pass validation.
    Logs of the validation steps and HTTP traffic are provided for each test. A link is also provided to
    download a combined log of all tests.
</p>
<p>
    If any validation run is unclear to you, or if you experience any problems with the API validator, please
    email your technical contact with your question and the URL of the validation run.
</p>

<h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>
    After successful validation with this online validator tool, ChannelAdvisor
    will begin the next phase of the partner launch cycle: integration verification. That will include
    more in-depth validation of the API than is currently possible in this online validator tool.
    It will also include the creation and testing of an synchronization task that will provide the
    integrate between ChannelAdvisor's test environments and the Access API.
</p>

<h4>Example mode</h4>
<p>
    Running a test suite in "Example mode" instructs the validator to return what a successful run against
    the API <span style="font-style: italic">should</span> look like. It does this by running a test suite
    against a test API component implemented by ChannelAdvisor that passes all validation requirements.
    Use this example validation feature as a model or "cheat sheet" when writing or debugging your Access API.
</p>

<h4>Products test suite</h4>
<p>
    The products test suite runs a series of tests against the products endpoints of the Access
    API and provides real-time feedback to partners about any endpoints that display behavior
    or return responses that are not consistent with the API requirements as outlined in the
    <a href="/ApiDocumentation/Products/ApiEndpoints">Products API Endpoints</a> documentation.
</p>
<p>
    The test suite contains the following tests:
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Add products</td>
        <td>Creates a certain number of new products on the API</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Get all products</td>
        <td>Gets all products from the API and validates their state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Add update products</td>
        <td>Creates and updates a certain number of products on the API</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Get all products</td>
        <td>Gets all products from the API and validates their state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Update price and quantity</td>
        <td>Updates the price and quantity of certain items on the API</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Get all products</td>
        <td>Gets all products from the API and validates their state</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>Update listing status</td>
        <td>Updates the listing status of certain items on the API</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>Get all products</td>
        <td>Gets all products from the API and validates their state</td>
    </tr>

    </tbody>

</table>
<p></p>

<h4>Orders test suite</h4>
<p>
    The orders test suite runs a series of tests against the orders endpoints of the Access
    API and provides real-time feedback to partners about any endpoints that display behavior
    or return responses that are not consistent with the API requirements as outlined in the
    <a href="/ApiDocumentation/Orders/ApiEndpoints">Orders API Endpoints</a> documentation.
</p>
<p>
    The test suite contains the following tests:
</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>#</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

    </tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
