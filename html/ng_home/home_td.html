<h1>Template Definition</h1>
<h2>What is a Template?</h2>
<p>
    Alongside your taxonomy and category documentation, Voyageone requires additional information on your product fields
    in order to properly surface these to sellers in our platform.
</p>

<p>
    A template is the seller-facing version of the fields on your taxonomy.
    Templates within the Voyageone platform show, to the seller, the field names,
    their requirement status as well as added context (called Help Text) in order to assist the seller in mapping their
    template.
</p>

<h3>How to Submit Your Template Definition File</h3>
<p>
    We offer a standard template to our OpenAPI Voyageone partners which includes standard fields which are similar
    across channels. You can download a copy of our standard
    template <a class="link" href="#/ng_home/home_general">here</a>. Should our standard template not match your
    requirements, you must opt for a custom template.
</p>

<p>
    In a custom template, you can provide all fields relevant to your specific channel. Please note that a custom
    template requires additional development work and, as such, may incur a cost.
</p>

<p>
    In order to help you supply us with your custom template, we have provided a document which will give you an
    overview of the required data points with examples and suggestions to help you complete the file.
    You can download a copy of the file <a class="link"
                                           href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BlgimR9J7mjXAb2_C3NS6WqOENxfr3mGIROdVKxl8FQ"
                                           target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Our engineering team cannot commence the Voyageone side of the development
    process without this information, so timing is critical.
    Please ensure your template definition file is either at same time as you are preparing for final verification or
    before.
</p>
