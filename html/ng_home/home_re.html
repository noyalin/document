<h1>Requirements </h1>
<blockquote>Requirements page outlines in detail what deliverables are required for each marketplace.</blockquote>
<p>
    Along with the technical integration and requirements,
    there is basic information that Voyageone will need to be able to create a template for sellers to
    provide product data in your required format. We also require additional information from you that will
    enable us to communicate the value of your site to our sellers and to prepare them to connect to your
    program through Voyageone.
</p>

<p>
    You should start preparing the following deliverables as soon as your agreement is signed with
    Voyageone.
    It is also important to note that we cannot commence Voyageone development as outlined in the process
    flow until we receive the following information; any delays in receiving these details will push out your
    potential go-live date.
