<h2>General API information</h2>
<p>
    OpenAPI Voyageone is a program that enables channel partners to integrate with Voyageone’s e-commerce platform, and
    ultimately our sellers.
    The goal of this program is to connect online sellers with new sources of demand.
</p>
<p>
    Once in the OpenAPI Voyageone program, channel partners will build an HTTP API to the specifications outlined in
    this portal and expose common e-commerce
    operations in a standardized form to Voyageone. Voyageone will then utilize this API to synchronize product and
    order data on behalf of retailers.
</p>
<p>
    The integration model is intended to work for a variety of channels and processes. At a high level, we will be
    sending requests and receiving information from the channel on:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adding or updating product content</li>
    <li>Updates to quantity and price</li>
    <li>Enabling or disabling products on the site</li>
    <li>Orders</li>
    <li>Shipment details</li>
    <li>Cancellations/Refunds</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Additional details and technical specifications can be found in the API Documentation pages.
    If after review of the specifications you have additional questions specific to your channel, or have a process that
    does not fit into the predefined workflow, reach out to
    your business development contact for more information.
