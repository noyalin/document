<h3>Order Status Values</h3>
<p>
    This is an explanation of the purpose and meaning of the various ChannelAdvisor-defined
    <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a> values, and how orders will progress from one
    status to
    another over their lifetime.
</p>

<!-- Order status table -->
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th style="min-width: 15em;">Order Status</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>1 / Pending</td>
        <td>
            <p>
                The Pending status indicates that the order has been created on the site, but it is not yet
                ready for seller fulfillment at this time. There are many reasons you may wish to represent
                an order in this status. Perhaps the payment has not yet been processed, or perhaps the order
                is being processed through your site's buyer fraud/risk assessment. If there is any reason the
                order should not be sent on to the seller to fulfill, the order should maintain the Pending status.
                ChannelAdvisor will skip over orders that are in the pending state when downloading new orders to
                bring to the seller for fulfillment. If your site does no support the concept of pending orders,
                you may return an empty list from the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_getorders">Get orders</a>
                endpoint when the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a> passed to you is 1
                / Pending
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2 / ReleasedForShipment</td>
        <td>
            <p>
                Once any roadblocks have been cleared that were causing the order to be held in 1 / Pending
                status (if any), the order should be returned with an <a class="link"
                                                                         href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a>
                of
                2 / ReleasedForShipment. This indicates that the order has met all the site's
                requirements and is now ready for the seller to fulfill. ChannelAdvisor will query for orders in this
                state
                very frequently (about once every 15 minutes or so) and import the data of all orders in this state to
                our system
                for the seller to view and fulfill. If the order's math adds up and the order passes validation, it will
                then be ingested
                into our system. Please refer to the validation and math rules below.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3 / AcknowledgedBySeller</td>
        <td>
            <p>
                Once ChannelAdvisor imports a 2 / ReleasedForShipment order into our system, we will
                immediately issue a call to your <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_acknowledge">Acknowledge
                order</a> endpoint
                to inform you that the order has been successfully imported. At this point, your API should set the
                order's state to
                3 / AcknowledgedBySeller. This indicates that the order has been received by the seller
                and is awaiting the seller's fulfillment.
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4 / PartiallyShipped<br>5 / Shipped</td>
        <td>
            <p>
                If the seller chooses to fulfill the order, he will generally do the following in order:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Package up the order</li>
                <li>Give the order to the carrier for delivery to the buyer</li>
                <li>Mark the order as shipped in ChannelAdvisor (carrier and tracking information may or may not be
                    supplied).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Once the seller has provided us the shipping information, we will send it to your API by posting to the
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_shiporder">Ship order</a> endpoint. Once you receive this
                information,
                your system should perform any crucial validation on the request, and then immediately set the
                order's state to 4 / PartiallyShipped or 5 / Shipped,
                depending on the shipping information we sent you. We may send shipment data multiple times as the
                seller ships more items,
                corrects tracking information, etc. It will be up to you to apply any deltas and update the correct
                shipping status accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE</span><br>
                A request to the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_shiporder">Ship order</a> endpoint is a bit
                different
                from other endpoints. Usually, a POST request signifies that ChannelAdvisor is asking your system to do
                something on behalf of
                the seller (like list a product, pull down a product, refund an order, etc). However, in the case of
                fulfillment, we are simply
                notifying you that a shipment has already taken place. If your system cannot successfully process that
                information, you can return
                an error. For example, if the seller did not provide what your system deems to be a valid tracking
                number, you could return the
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_errorid">ErrorID</a> 6101 / InvalidTrackingNumber. We would then
                let the seller know that
                sending shipping information to your site failed for the reason you specified. He may then choose to
                correct his data and try again,
                or he may not. Either way, the item is usually already on its way to the buyer.
            </p>
            <p>
                For that reason, we currently expect that the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a>
                of the order should change to
                4 / PartiallyShipped or 5 / Shipped as an immediate result of the
                call to the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_shiporder">Ship order</a> endpoint. Any site
                fulfillment logic must either:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Execute and return success or failure as part of the response from the
                    <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_shiporder">Ship order</a> endpoint, or
                </li>
                <li>
                    Be processed after the endpoint has already returned its result. If this is the case, the back-end
                    processing should by handled
                    separate and apart from the API logic, meaning that any success or failure on the part of this site
                    logic should not
                    affect the order's <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Either way, at the end of the call to the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_shiporder">Ship
                order</a> endpoint,
                the response should either have succeeded and the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a>
                should now be either
                4 / PartiallyShipped or 5 / Shipped, or else the response should have an
                error and the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a> should remain as it was
                prior to the call.
            </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6 / Canceled</td>
        <td>
            <p>
                If the seller chooses not to fulfill an order, he will mark the order as canceled in the ChannelAdvisor
                application.
                Within a few minutes after he does this, we will issue a call to your
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_cancelorder">Cancel order</a> endpoint
                to indicate that the seller has decided not to fulfill the order. Your system should then set the
                order's <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_ordestatus">OrderStatus</a> to 6 / Canceled.
                If the item has already been fully or partially shipped, we will instead call the
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_refundorder">Refund order</a> endpoint
                to make the request. The expected behavior of both endpoints is the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the math that sites use to calculate refunds/cancellation amounts varies greatly between
                ChannelAdvisor's partners, a refund amount property is not provided to you in the
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_cancelorder">Cancel order</a> and
                <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_refundorder">Refund order</a> endpoint payloads.
                You will be supplied with the SKU and the quantity to be refunded/canceled. It is up to your
                system to calculate how much that refund entails and issue the transaction for that amount.

<!-- Order math and validation -->
<h3>Order math and validation</h3>
<p>
    Before an order can by imported into ChannelAdvisor, it will be validated to ensure that all numeric
    values on the order add up correctly, and that all required properties have valid values. You may refer to
    the <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_order">Order</a> model page for the list of required properties. If a
    field is required,
    you must supply a value-- null is not acceptable. Here are the rules around how order totals should add up:
</p>
<p>
    The order total must be equal to (the sum of the items' (quantity * unit price value)) + (all other price fields).
    If the order is marked as being VAT-inclusive order, the tax fields are not factored into the order total directly.
</p>

<h3>Special notes</h3>

<h4>Repeated and split shipments</h4>
<p>
    To allow maximum flexibility, ChannelAdvisor offers sellers the ability to split items from a single order across
    multiple
    shipments. The seller can also send multiple updates for any given shipment. Please be aware that not all items in
    an order
    will necessarily be shipped together, and that you may receive a shipment update for an item/order more than once.
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Please design your system to accept this widely accepted process.</p>

<h4>What to do when VAT amounts are unknown</h4>
<p>
    If your site receives an order that is VAT-inclusive, you are responsible for calculating how much the VAT amount
    is for the purpose of representing the order in the API. If you do not have the exact VAT amount available, you
    can do one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a style="font-weight: bold;">Look it up</a>
        if you have a system you can retrieve the VAT amount from, this is preferable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a style="font-weight: bold;">Calculate / approximate it</a><br>
        If you know or can estimate the VAT percentage, you can calculate approximately how much of the
        amount paid was VAT tax.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a style="font-weight: bold;">Do not send it</a><br>
        If you have now way of looking up or calculating the VAT amount for the order, you may send
        the order as a non-VAT order with a tax amount of 0. This places the burden of calculating the
        VAT amount onto the seller, so it is not the preferred option, but it will work.
    </li>
</ul>
