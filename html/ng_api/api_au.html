<h1>Authentication</h1>
<blockquote>Describes the API authentication protocols.</blockquote>
<h3>Seller identification</h3>
<p>
    When on-boarding new sellers, you (the integration partner) will provide each seller with a unique seller ID
    and seller API token. The seller will then provide these identifiers in the Voyageone application when they
    configure
    their integration. Voyageone will include them in every request to your API in the form of the SellerID and
    SellerToken
    HTTP headers. You should use these header values to associate the request with a seller's account and to
    authenticate the integration.
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>HTTP Header</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>SellerID</td>
        <td>A unique, seller-specific identifier assigned by your system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SellerToken</td>
        <td>A unique, seller-specific token assigned by your system.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>In the case of authorization failure, the API response should return one of the following <a
        href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_errorid" class="link">ErrorID</a> values:</p>
<table class="">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Error ID</th>
        <th>Example Error Message</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>4002 (InvalidSellerID)</td>
        <td>Authorization failed. Invalid SellerID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4001 (InvalidToken)</td>
        <td>Authorization failed. Invalid SellerToken</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p></p>

<h4>Security Protocol</h4>
<p>
    All connections from the Voyageone production environment must be made using HTTPS to provide transport layer
    security.
    It is strongly recommended that you also enable HTTPS transport for any testing or sandbox API as well.
