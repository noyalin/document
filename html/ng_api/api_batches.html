<h1>Batches</h1>
<blockquote>Overview of the way that batch endpoints should be implemented.</blockquote>
<h3>Purpose of Batching</h3>
<p>
    To facilitate the timely querying and processing of products and orders, the API specification is implemented
    in a way that allows many endpoints to accept return a collection (batch) or elements in lieu of a single element.
    This enables a higher throughput of product content, and
    price / quantity updates, and orders between your system and the Voyageone application. Exactly how many elements to
    put in each batch
    request to the API is configurable, and will be provided by you to your Voyageone business contact during launch.
    If your system cannot support processing multiple elements in a single request, this maximum batch size can be set
    to one.
</p>

<h3>Special Notes</h3>
<p>Please consider the following considerations when developing your API endpoints that process batches</p>

<h4>Element-level errors</h4>
<p>
    All batch endpoints should return element-level errors (as opposed to response-level errors) where possible.
    For more information on the distinction between these two error placements, please see the
    <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_e_overview">Errors Overview</a> page.
</p>

<h4>One-to-One batch element matching</h4>
<p>
    Voyageone requires that there be a one-to-one matching between the elements in a request batch and the
    elements in the response batch. This mapping is determined based on the unique identifier of the batch element
    (SellerSKU for <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_productgroup">ProductGroup</a> / <a class="link"
                                                                                              href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_buyableproduct">BuyableProduct</a>,
    and
    ID for <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_order">Order</a></code>). For example, if 3-item batch request is sent
    to the
    <a class="link" href="#/ng_api/api_r_e_createupdate">Create and update products</a> endpoint containing SellerSKUs
    "ABC", "DEF", and "EFG" Voyageone would expect a 3-item response containing those same SellerSKUs.
</p>

<h4>Element IDs</h4>
<p>
    Please note that the identifier of the elements returned in the batch response must match the identifier of the
    element
    sent in the batch request exactly-- character for character. For example, if your system XML-encodes all SKUs when
    storing them, and
    your API is sent an item with SellerSKU "PURSE&amp;BAG" then the actual stored value in your database may be "PURSE&amp;amp;BAG."
    Your API will need to handle cases like this where the value stored in your system differs from the value sent by
    Voyageone
    and both accept and return the value that was originally sent ("PURSE&amp;BAG") in all API responses.
</p>
<p>
    Alternately, if reversing to the original value is not possible for your system, you may return an <a class="link"
                                                                                                          href="#/ng_api/api_r_m_error">Error</a>
    for that element in the batch indicating that the value is not valid per your system specifications.
</p>
