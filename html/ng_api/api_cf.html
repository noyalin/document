<h4>Content Management</h4>
<p>
    During the content management process, Voyageone will perform multiple actions that involve products. Our system
    will first request a full catalog of
    products. This allows us to reconcile differences between the two systems. Next the integration will send new and
    updated products should there be any since the last time the process executed. The partner will
    then be required to reflect these changes or additions in their system. Should any of these products fail
    validation, the partner will return a list of failed products with the associated errors.
    Finally the integration will send a list of status updates for products that have become unavailable in Voyageone
    and should be marked as such in the partner's system. This process executes on a
    schedule, which can be customized based on the partner's preference.

<h4>Quantity and Price Management</h4>
<p>
    The quantity and price management process executes on a more frequent basis due to the critical need for keeping
    quantity up-to-date. Voyageone will only send quantity and prices for products that have
    changed since the last time the process executed. Also part of this process, the integration will send a list of
    status updates for products that have become unavailable in Voyageone and should be marked
    as such in the partner's system. This process executes on a schedule, which can be customized based on the partner's
    preference.
