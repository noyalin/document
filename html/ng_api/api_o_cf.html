<h4>Order Management</h4>
<p>
    During the order management process, Voyageone will perform multiple actions that involve orders. Our system will
    first request a list of orders
    with the status "ReleasedForShipment", which will then be imported into our system. For each order that is imported,
    Voyageone will send an
    order acknowledgement to the partner, indicating a successful import. Next, the process will send shipment updates
    per order to the partner for all orders
    the Seller has marked as "shipped" in Voyageone. The final part of the process will send either refund or
    cancellation requests for orders that the Seller
    has marked as such in Voyageone. This process executes on a schedule, which can be customized based on the partner's
    preference.
